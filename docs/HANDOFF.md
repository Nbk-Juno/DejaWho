### Architecture deepening (11B) summary

Six improvements shipped in one commit (`0f19972`):

1. **Encounter embedding text** — `encounterEmbeddingText()` in `shared/schema.ts` is single source of truth for how encounters are embedded.
2. **Hybrid search consolidation** — `server/encounter-search.ts` is the single module for all scoring, ranking, date/location extraction.
3. **AI billing** — `billableAiCall(userId, op, fn)` in `server/usage-counters.ts` is the single lifecycle for all OpenAI calls (reserve → call → rollback on failure). Added `encounter_embeddings` op + migration 0003.
4. **Typed API contract** — `ApiEncounter` / `toApiEncounter` / `ApiSearchResponse` in `shared/schema.ts`. All encounter routes strip `embedding` and `userId` from responses; `datetime`/`createdAt` are ISO strings. Client uses wire types throughout.
5. **Voice search hook** — `client/src/hooks/use-voice-search.ts` owns the full record→transcribe→search→TTS flow. Fixes `isVoiceMode` persistence bug, audio cleanup on unmount, removes `setTimeout` hack.
6. **Routes decomposition** — `server/routes.ts` is now 18-line wiring. Domain logic in `account-operations.ts`, `encounter-operations.ts`, `search-operations.ts`. `userIdFrom` moved to `server/auth.ts`; `handleAiPolicyError` moved to `server/ai-policy.ts`.

## What's live

- **URL:** https://dejawho.io (also https://dejawho.onrender.com)
- **Hosting:** Render free tier (sleeps after 15min idle, ~30s cold start)
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres (prod project `tdjeeqxdzgrhgkgcpopz`) via transaction pooler
- **Auth:** Supabase email/password (primary) + magic-link via Resend SMTP + password reset flow
- **Error tracking:** Sentry (DSN configured in Render env vars)
- **Allow-listed users:** doplitog@gmail.com, priscilla.ventura@gmail.com

## Open issues

- **#14** — Verify iOS audio codec fallback with tests and manual QA (needs iPhone in-hand)
- **#13** — Draft privacy policy and ToS (parked until closer to wider launch)
- ~~**#1** — Parent PRD issue~~ — closed, all phases complete
- ~~**#25** — Resend verified domain~~ — closed, `noreply@dejawho.io` confirmed working

## Known issues from deploy

- **Resend email deliverability:** Magic link emails sent via Resend (`onboarding@resend.dev` sender) may not reach inbox. Fix: verify `dejawho.io` domain in Resend, add the DNS records (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) to the registrar, then update the Supabase Auth SMTP sender to `noreply@dejawho.io`. In progress — see issue #25.
- **Service worker caching:** After a Render rebuild, returning users may get stale cached JS. They need to clear site data or unregister the service worker to pick up new builds. Consider adding a cache-busting strategy or SW version check.
- **Render cold starts:** Free tier sleeps after 15min. First request after sleep takes ~30s. Acceptable for friends-and-family.

## Pending prod actions

- **Apply migration `0005_person_identity` to prod Supabase** (multi-person disambiguation). Render does NOT auto-apply migrations — after this merges, run it via the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool (or paste the SQL into the Supabase SQL editor) and verify the new `encounters.person_id` / `last_name` and `persons.last_name` / `location_tag` columns exist. Skipping this causes route-level 500s (`42703 column ... does not exist`).

## Post-launch follow-ups (not yet tracked as issues)

- ~~Purchase `dejawho.app` domain~~ → **dejawho.io** acquired, Render custom domain + TLS wired up — live at https://dejawho.io
- ~~GitHub repo rename from `Who-That` to `DejaWho`~~ — done
- ~~iPhone Safari manual QA session (voice record, voice search, PWA install)~~ — done
- ~~Verify Resend deliverability~~ — done, `noreply@dejawho.io` confirmed working
- Broader test user feedback collection
